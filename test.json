This module focuses on the ways in which writers and critical practitioners produce different accounts of migrant experience across as well as between time and space. Particular emphasis is given, to writing from the late Victorian period through to the early twentieth-century, because it is a time of considerable movement across the world and has created a troubled and troubling legacy of colonial knowledge that continues to interest writers. The module will also focus on the writing of earlier migrations and the pre- and early-colonial period.\n\nIn so doing, the module shows how English imperial values, ideals and structures are adapted and creatively interpreted in a foreign context; it also shows how literature is affected by significant differences in position, as writers respond to, and write out of and against, the colonial project. Settler texts from colonial territories may also studied as a critical component in empire writing. Building on a secure knowledge of the concept of colonialism, the module focuses on the various ways writers respond creatively to the troubled and troubling legacy of imperial domination.\n\nWhile the concept of migrant literature may be examined and defined through studying a range of texts from different regions in Britain, particular emphasis is given to the experience of Black and Asian writers in the development of migrant literature. The reason for this focus is not to construct a group or impose a singular identity on particular writers; rather, it is to encourage students to reflect on both the means by which texts engage with the triple bind of ethnic, geographical and literary belonging in contemporary Britain.\n \nThe module supports skills and concepts developed in \u0018 Places and Spaces\u0019  at level 4,  ENGL2201, and ENGL2202 Migration and Movement.  \n","label":0},{"title":"GOTHIC AND ROMANTIC LITERATURE","code":"ENGL2203","description":"This module introduces students to a range of Gothic and Romantic literature from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

Some images may be harmless, but we can learn a lot from them about the world. However, they can also be used by powerful interests to distort information, trying to manipulate people. Ordinary citizens and social movements then try to counteract them, with their own rival images. Sociology can usefully investigate this to try to discover more about what is going on in the world and where power lies within it.

Moreover, the claim that certain emotions are typical of some groups (e.g. women) can be used to belittle or marginalise them. However, ordinary citizens may be empowered by emotions which generate resistance, such as social movements. This tension, between emotions as oppressive or liberatory, helps with the classic sociological and political question: are people prisoners of structures over which they have little control, or can they exercise human agency to overcome such constraints and thus determine their own lives?

During this time, Earth has experienced numerous and significant environmental changes, the most dramatic of which being the quasi-periodic expansion of mid-latitude ice sheets on multiple occasions. The Quaternary is notable not just for the magnitude of environmental changes, but also for the rapidity at which some of these changes occurred. Studying Quaternary environmental change helps us better understand the workings of the climate system, including the various feedback mechanisms that can amplify or subdue an initial forcing (e.g. an increase in atmospheric CO2). An appreciation of Quaternary environmental change is also necessary to fully understand the geologically-recent evolution of the Earth\u0019s surface and its biota, and provides the context for the study of the pre-history of humans in Britain.","label":0},{"title":"POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY","code":"GEOG3131","description":"Relationships between people and their wider environment cannot be separated from political considerations.
